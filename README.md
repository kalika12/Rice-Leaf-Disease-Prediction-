# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Prediction-

Of the three major crops – rice, wheat and maize – rice is by far the most important food crop for people in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Although rich and poor people alike eat rice in low-income countries, the poorest people consume relatively little wheat and are therefore deeply affected by the cost and availability of rice.

In many Asian countries, rice is the fundamental and generally irreplaceable staple, especially of the poor. For the extreme poor in Asia, who live on less than dollar 1.25 a day, rice accounts for nearly half of their food expenditures and a fifth of total household expenditures, on average. This group alone annually spends the equivalent of $62 billion (purchasing power parity) on rice. Rice is critical to food security for many of the world’s poor people.
